T               Stack trace.
s [expr]        Single step [in expr].
n [expr]        Next, steps over subroutine calls [in expr].
<CR>            Repeat last n or s command.
r               Return from current subroutine.
c [line|sub]    Continue; optionally inserts a one-time-only breakpoint
                at the specified position.
l min+incr      List incr+1 lines starting at min.
l min-max       List lines min through max.
l line          List single line.
l subname       List first window of lines from subroutine.
l               List next window of lines.
-               List previous window of lines.
w [line]        List window around line.
.               Return to the executed line.
f filename      Switch to viewing filename. Must be loaded.
/pattern/       Search forwards for pattern; final / is optional.
?pattern?       Search backwards for pattern; final ? is optional.
L               List all breakpoints and actions.
S [[!]pattern]  List subroutine names [not] matching pattern.
t               Toggle trace mode.
t expr          Trace through execution of expr.
b [line] [condition]
                Set breakpoint; line defaults to the current execution line;
                condition breaks if it evaluates to true, defaults to '1'.
b subname [condition]
                Set breakpoint at first line of subroutine.
b load filename Set breakpoint on `require'ing the given file.
b postpone subname [condition]
                Set breakpoint at first line of subroutine after
                it is compiled.
b compile subname
                Stop after the subroutine is compiled.
d [line]        Delete the breakpoint for line.
D               Delete all breakpoints.
a [line] command
                Set an action to be done before the line is executed.
                Sequence is: check for breakpoint/watchpoint, print line
                if necessary, do action, prompt user if necessary,
                execute expression.
A               Delete all actions.
W expr          Add a global watch-expression.
W               Delete all watch-expressions.
V [pkg [vars]]  List some (default all) variables in package (default current).
                Use ~pattern and !pattern for positive and negative regexps.
X [vars]        Same as "V currentpackage [vars]".
x expr          Evals expression in array context, dumps the result.
m expr          Evals expression in array context, prints methods callable
                on the first element of the result.
m class         Prints methods callable via the given class.
O [opt[=val]] [opt"val"] [opt?]...
                Set or query values of options.  val defaults to 1.  opt can
                be abbreviated.  Several options can be listed.
    recallCommand, ShellBang:   chars used to recall command or spawn shell;
    pager:                      program for output of "|cmd";
    tkRunning:                  run Tk while prompting (with ReadLine);
    signalLevel warnLevel dieLevel:     level of verbosity;
    inhibit_exit                Allows stepping off the end of the script.
    ImmediateStop               Debugger should stop as early as possible.
  The following options affect what happens with V, X, and x commands:
    arrayDepth, hashDepth:      print only first N elements ('' for all);
    compactDump, veryCompact:   change style of array and hash dump;
    globPrint:                  whether to print contents of globs;
    DumpDBFiles:                dump arrays holding debugged files;
    DumpPackages:               dump symbol tables of packages;
    DumpReused:         dump contents of "reused" addresses;
    quote, HighBit, undefPrint: change style of string dump;
    bareStringify:              Do not print the overload-stringified value;
  Option PrintRet affects printing of return value after r command,
         frame    affects printing messages on entry and exit from subroutines.
         AutoTrace affects printing messages on every possible breaking point.
         maxTraceLen gives maximal length of evals/args listed in stack trace.
         ornaments affects screen appearance of the command line.
                During startup options are initialized from $ENV{PERLDB_OPTS}.
                You can put additional initialization options TTY, noTTY,
                ReadLine, and NonStop there (or use `R' after you set them).
< expr          Define Perl command to run before each prompt.

R               Pure-man-restart of debugger, some of debugger state
                and command-line options may be lost.
                Currently the following setting are preserved:
                history, breakpoints and actions, debugger Options
                and the following command-line options: -w, -I, -e.
h [db_command]  Get help [on a specific debugger command], enter |h to page.
h h             Summary of debugger commands.
q or ^D         Quit. Set $DB::finished = 0 to debug global destruction.
